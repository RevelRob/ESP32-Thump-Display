feat: Implement message scrolling and fix mirror mode bugs

This commit introduces several improvements to the message display functionality:

- Implemented auto-scrolling for long messages to ensure full readability.
- Fixed a bug that caused mirrored text to scroll at a slower speed.
- Corrected the color of mirrored text from red to green.

The README, TODO, and changelog have been updated to reflect these new features and bug fixes.
