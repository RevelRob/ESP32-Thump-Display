- Moved button-related state variables from `globals.h` and `main.cpp` into `buttons.cpp` as static variables.
- Moved brightness display logic and related variables from `globals.h` and `main.cpp` into `display.cpp` as static variables.
- Updated `TODO.md` to mark the refactoring tasks as complete.
- Updated `context.md` to document the refactoring.
