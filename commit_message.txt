feat: Implement #CARDS smart text feature

This commit introduces the #CARDS Smart Text feature, allowing the device to receive and display playing cards.

- Implemented the `#CARDS` command, which waits for a subsequent message containing a card code.
- Card codes are parsed to determine the card's rank and suit, and the result is displayed on the screen (e.g., "Ace of Spades").
- Changed the Smart Text command prefix from `!` to `#` for all commands.
- The `CLEAR` command is now a single `#`.
- Fixed a bug that prevented the card name from being displayed after being processed.
- Updated `README.md` with instructions for the new `#CARDS` feature and the updated command prefix.
- Updated `TODO.md` to reflect the implementation of the feature.
