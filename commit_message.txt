fix: Update display code to use ScrollState struct

This commit fixes compilation errors in `display.cpp` that arose after refactoring the message scrolling variables into a `ScrollState` struct.

- Replaced direct references to `isCurrentMessageLong`, `scrollOffset`, `scrollState`, `lastScrollTime`, `currentFont`, and `totalMessageHeight` with their corresponding members in the `messageScroll` struct (e.g., `messageScroll.isLong`, `messageScroll.offset`).
- This resolves the "not declared in this scope" errors and makes the display and scrolling logic consistent with the new data structure.
